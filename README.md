## :book: About the project
This project allowed me to experiment with OpenCV and MediaPipe in Python, an area in which I've recently been interested in. This software utilises OpenCV and MediaPipe to allow the user to control the Google Chrome Offline Dino game through hand gesture recognition by pressing together two fingers (index and thumb for jumping, pinky and thumb for crouching).
